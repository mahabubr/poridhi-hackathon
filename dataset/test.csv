Designed to deliver ultra-high quality images along with lightning fast operation, the new Canon EF 70-300 f/4-5.6L IS USM telephoto zoom lens brings a favorite zoom range to the celebrated Canon L-series of lenses. It features two Ultra Low Dispersion (UD) elements for improved image quality and reduced chromatic aberration, incorporates a floating focusing mechanism for sharpness from close up to infinity, plus an IS system that increases usability by approximately four stops. The EF 70-300 f/4-5.6L IS USM features a function that prevents erroneous operation when the lens is mounted on a tripod or monopod. Gleaming white, with a removable tripod collar, dust and water resistant construction, and a newly developed Fluorine coating that keeps soiling, smears and fingerprints to a minimum, its phenomenal performance and flexibility is assured. For portraiture or to bring what's far away up close, this addition to the L-series is guaranteed to perform.

The advantages are obvious: lenses can be swapped easily without extra hardware or adjustment, nothing jolts the camera unexpectedly during follow-focus, one-man camera operation is easier, and control at a distance is as simple as extending the cable between the camera and the remote. The Clamp-On Remote is perfectly integrated into the SYMPLA system, fitting comfortably to the spacer element of a SYMPLA Adjustable Handle and allowing fingertip control of key camera functions without moving the hand from the grips, in turn making support more stable and secure. <br />

New 4/3-inch High Sensitivity MOS Sensor

The DMC-LX100 is designed to render breathtaking gradation and rich textures in all their natural beauty. It incorporates a new 4/3-inch large High Sensitivity MOS sensor with multiple aspect ratios. By keeping the resolution to 12.8 Mpx (in 4:3 setting), the amount of light is maintained to improve the S/N ratio, making it possible to capture clear images with minimum noise, even when shot at ISO 25600. Sensor total pixel is 16.8 Mpx.



F1.7-2.8 LEICA DC VARIO-SUMMILUX Lens

The newly developed LEICA DC VARIO-SUMMILUX lens boasts an F1.7-2.8 brightness, high speed, high detail and corner-to-corner resolution. The lens unit consists of 11 elements in 8 groups with 5 aspherical lenses including 2 ED lenses. To fit the camera body with its large 4/3-inch sensor, a new structure was designed that moves the entire lens group while Panasonic's original centering technology enhances the lens alignment sharpness. This lens also produces stunningly beautiful defocusing together with the large MOS sensor.



Supremely Creative Tool for Camera Enthusiasts

Turn the aperture ring with your left hand and operate the shutter speed dial with your right hand. These two controls adjust the exposure, which is critical for picture quality. Aim the camera and look into the 2,764K-dot equivalent high resolution LVF (Live View Finder) and your right hand will naturally rest on the exposure compensation dial. With the DMC-LX100, the photographer and the camera quickly become one.



Versatile Creative Effects

For more creative freedom, the DMC-LX100 integrates Creative Control (Filter), Creative Panorama and Photo Style. Notably, aperture and shutter speed can be adjusted while applying Creative Control filter, to further inspire the photographers"" creativity. Combining these and other functions allows virtually unlimited expression.



Capture High-Resolution Photos from 4K Video Recording

The 4K Photo leverages the camera""s 4K video recording capability and cuts out a 3840 x 2160 8-megapixel equivalent image from the 4K video footage, enabling users to capture spur-of-the-moment shots which are often missed in still image photography. Once the 4K Photo mode is entered, the luminance level is adjusted to 0-255, which is suitable for photos. You can also choose your desired aspect ratio (4:3, 3:2 or 16:9). 4K video can be recorded for up to 15 minutes. When recording videos in 4K, use an SD card rated as UHS Speed Class 3.



Smooth, Beautiful Defocus Effect

The newly developed LEICA DC VARIO-SUMMILUX lens features optimization of optical design and 5 aspherical glass lenses, which are made possible by Panasonic's unique aspherical lens mold technology. This combines with the large MOS sensor to give your photos a shallow depth of field with an impressive defocus effect featuring invisible edge lines. The newly adopted 9-aperture diaphragm also helps to produce bokeh with a smooth, circular shape.



Advanced Venus EngineImage Processor

The Venus Engine features Multi-Process NR, 3D Colour Control and Aperture Filter to achieve high colour reproduction and high resolution images with natural description. The combination of the High Sensitivity MOS sensor and the Venus Engine achieves stunning picture quality that rivals that of D-SLRs.



Multiple Aspect Ratios

The Multi-aspect ratio function in LUMIX lets you record images in 4:3, 3:2 or 16:9 aspect ratio with the same angle of view and can quickly be set with the aspect switch on the lens barrel.



Macro Shooting (3 cm)

Stunning macro shots can be taken with a minimum focusing distance of 3 cm (wide) and 30 cm (tele). You can shoot close-ups with the DMC-LX100 to express the spectacular details of flowers, animals, insects, etc., and the POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) effectively compensates for handshake.



Analog-Like Operation

A variety of advanced functions are featured on the DMC-LX100 to expand the potential of advanced photographers. It allows direct, intuitive control with dedicated rings and dials such as the aperture ring, control ring for zooming or focusing, shutter speed dial and exposure compensation dial.



2,764K-dot Equivalent High Resolution Live View Finder

The DMC-LX100 integrates an LVF (Live View Finder) with 2,764K-dot equivalent high resolution and approx. 100% colour reproduction. It assures stable framing and superb visibility even under strong sunlight. The Eye Sensor AF starts auto focusing by just looking into the LVF so you won't miss any shooting opportunities. Also, a 3.0-inch, 921K-dot rear monitor is available. Based on the Adobe RGB color space, Panasonic in-house comparison based on the CIE 1931 x, y color space.



Light Speed AF with DFD Technology

New DFD (Depth from Defocus) technology shortens the time to set focus. It instantaneously calculates the distance to the subject by evaluating 2 images with different sharpness levels. As a result, ultra high speed AF of approx. 0.14 sec is achieved. CIPA standard. The zoom position is in wide range. When using Live View Finder.



Fast Shutter Speed

A high shutter speed at max. 1/4000 sec enables you to capture spur-of-the-moment, fast moving subjects. You can open the aperture even outdoors (Max. 1/16000 sec) with an electronic shutter reducing washouts even under strong sunlight.

Burst Shooting (11 fps)

High-speed burst shooting is possible at 11 fps at full resolution and together with a quick start-up and a short release time lag, the DMC-LX100 will make sure you catch those fleeting shooting opportunities.



Focus Peaking Function with Control Ring

Manual control is easy thanks to the Control Ring, which enables direct, intuitive control over frequently-used functions and settings. The Focus Peaking function shows the peak of focus in MF and AF MF modes. It is also available in remote photo / video shooting with a smartphone / tablet via Wi-Fi.

Level Gauge

The Level Gauge lets the camera detect the horizontal / vertical angle of view which is convenient to make level in composition.



Aspect Bracket

The Aspect Bracket function lets the camera take an image in all aspect ratios simultaneously (4:3, 3:2, 16:9 and 1:1).

WB Bracket

A WB (White Balance) bracket is available that records 3 images with different white balance parameters at a single shutter release.

Monochrome in Photo Style

The Monochrome Filter (Ye/Or/R/G) of the Photo Style function creates rich expression using the limited hues of monochrome images.

Multi Exposure

The Multi Exposure function lets you take up to 4 exposures in a single frame and you can layer subjects that wouldn't ordinarily appear in the same frame.



Highlight / Shadow Control

Highlight and shadow can be adjusted to achieve desired images without the use of image processing software. 3 patterns of settings can be customized in addition to 3 preset patterns (Higher Contrast, Lower Contrast, Brighten Shadow).

RAW Data Development in Camera

The DMC-LX100 is capable of developing RAW image in-camera. In addition to the colour space setting (sRGB / AdobeRGB), the parameter of white balance, exposure compensation, contrast, highlight / shadow, saturation, noise reduciton, sharpness or hue can be adjusted while applying LUMIX's Photo Style, Intelligent D-range Control or Intelligent Resolution.

About the Cables


Four sets of 100 foot CCTV camera cables are included with this system. If you need to extend your cable run longer than 100 feet, you should consider upgrading to a RG59 cable spool, connector, and tool kit. This allows you to cut the cable to the exact length that you need.



Hybrid HD Surveillance DVR

	


	The DVR included with this security camera system is an SD / HD hybrid. This means that both traditional analog security cameras and AHD high definition security cameras can be used.


	Here is how it works.


	Originally, CCTV cameras supported D1 resolution which is 704 x 480 pixels.
	Then, 960H CCTV cameras were introduced which support 960 x 480 resolution (a wider format CCTV).
	In 2014, AHD cameras (analog high definition), also known as HD CCTV, was introduced which supports 720p resolution (1280 x 720).
	In 2015, full HD 1080p AHD cameras will be available.
	All of these CCTV video formats work using the same RG59 coax cable to run video from the camera to the DVR. However, the video encoding is different between traditional CCTV (D1 and 960H, also known as standard definition - SD) and AHD.
	This iDVR-E works with both traditional CCTV and AHD cameras. Users can also mix CCTV and AHD cameras on the same recorder (hybrid).
	Important! If both camera types will be used, they need to be grouped in pairs of 2 by type.
	For example, you can have 2 SD cameras on channels 1 and 2, and 2 AHD cameras on channels 3 and 4.
	You can also install SD cameras on all channels or HD cameras on all channels, but again, when you mix technologies, it must be done in groups of two.

You can 
learn more about what AHD is here.



iOS App




The iOS app lets users access the live view of their security cameras from remotely over the Internet. The iOS app works on iPhone and iPad devices.

Android App

Mac Software

The Mac client software that is included supports remote viewing and recorded video playback.


Windows Software

<br />
The MVH500AH is a lightweight head with a wider platform for HDSLR bodies and the sliding plate travels to balance the latest interchangeable lens cameras. The entry-level 500 ensures smooth shots and fine control with up to 5kg (11 lbs) of equipment. <br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s the most compact head in our successful Bridging Technology&trade; range and it also replaces the Manfrotto 701HDV video head. <br />
<br />
Beautifully smooth shots: the 500 has professional fluid cartridges on both pan and tilt axes to ensure that every camera movement is smooth, controlled and precise. <br />
<br />
Faster, easier and safer to use: the side lock system allows the camera and sliding QR plate to click quickly into the head from above, instead of needing to be aligned and slid in from the back. No secondary safety lock is necessary. The side lock system also makes it quicker and simpler to lift the camera out of the head from above. <br />
<br />
The 500 has a pre-set counterbalance of 2.4kg (5.3 lbs), but is able to support equipment of up to 5kg (11 lbs). The 500 has one Easy Link 3/8&rdquo; connector to allow an external monitor or other accessory equipment to be fitted.<br />
<br />
The 755CX3 Carbon Fibre MDeVe tripod is a hybrid two-stage (or 3-section), carbon fiber single leg-tube tripod that&rsquo;s compact and lightweight. It has a flat head plate, but a built-in MDeVe 50mm half-ball levelling system (locked by a rotating grip at the bottom of the centre column), which allows the camera operator to level the camera without needing to make micro adjustments to each individual tripod leg. Tension-adjustable flip leg levers make setting up and packing away the tripod fast and easy. <br />

This head is designed for executing cinematic moves with compact camcorders and DSLR video cameras. The 502HD comes in two versions -- the ""AH"" flat-base version, which this one is, and the ""A"" ball-base version, which is separately available.<br />
<br />
Weight capacity is 12.2 lb and counterbalance supports 8.8 lb. It can support 13 lb as a static weight. The balance plate's 3.27"" range allows you to correct for uneven payloads that might be due to matte boxes or exotic DSLR rig configurations.<br />
<br />
The bridging technology ensures that the pan friction control is intuitive and easy to set, but also protected against knocks. There are of course independent locks for pan and tilt, and drag for both is selectable in a continuous range from zero to the max level. This allows you to operate the head in a confident, smooth manner using the included pan bar.<br />

                                    Details
    Now there’s an even more versatile, more capable, more responsive version of Sony’s FS7. Based on feedback from cinematographers, we’ve complemented the FS7 with the FS7 II. Here’s all the performance of the original, and more. Surpass ordinary exposure control with our Electronic Variable ND filter. Secure your lenses with our Lever Lock type E-Mount. Work faster, with greater confidence thanks to even more refined ergonomics. And change your point of view with Sony’s highly capable 18-110mm servo zoom. Welcome to the next level in handheld shooting.
Electronic Variable ND
Here’s a fresh way to control exposure. Aperture adjustments affect your depth of field. Shutter speed adjustments affect the presentation of motion. But Sony’s Electronic Variable ND maintains optimum exposure without sacrificing any other parameters. Auto ND mode achieves auto exposure with cine lenses, rangefinder glass and third-party SLR lenses. And Auto ND empowers you to park your iris at the lens “sweet spot,” where distortions are lowest and resolution is highest.
Lever Lock type E-Mount
A robust E-Mount with a locking collar makes for more confident lens changes. To mount, simply hold the lens steady and turn the collar instead. When the collar clicks, your lens is securely locked into place. This minimizes image shifting as you work. The Lever Lock type E-Mount also supports heavier cine and ENG lenses without additional rigging. As before, the camera accepts Sony’s E-Mount lenses, along with simple third-party adaptors for PL mount cinema lenses, SLR and DSLR glass, and even classic rangefinder lenses.
Ergonomics to work faster, with more confidence
The ergonomics set the FS7 apart. Now they’re even better. Put the viewfinder exactly where you want it with the robust multi-adjustable arm. Extend Sony’s telescoping Smart Grip arm entirely without tools. Park the arm alongside the body for waist-level shooting. Then experience the Smart Grip, body shape and balance that so many cinematographers have praised.
And more
To the 4K Super35 performance of the original PXW-FS7, the FS7 II also adds the following refinements.

ITU-R BT.2020 recording is directly compatible with BT.2020 distribution
Pop-up LCD monitor hood in addition to the detachable eyepiece
Improved eyepiece hook for more secure attachment
Easier access to media cards for convenient removal

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

                                    Details
    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

                        Compact in size, light weight and fully featured, the Canon XF100 Professional Camcorder can be tailored to fit a wide range of individual needs. While sharing many of the capabilities of the Canon XF305 and XF300 Professional Camcorders, including the Canon XF Codec and Compact Flash (CF) recording, the XF100 offers some exciting new features of its own.

Whether used as a companion to the XF305 or XF300 or as a standalone camcorder, the XF100 is geared for a wide range of applications where high image quality, extreme portability, and efficient workflow are of the utmost importance. And with infrared recording and true stereoscopic 3-D production capabilities, the XF100 allows users to explore new creative outlets and emerging markets.

The XF100 utilizes Canon's XF Codec â a file-based MPEG-2 compression with an MXF File Wrapper that ensures the widest compatibility with existing industry infrastructure, metadata and non-linear editing (NLE) systems. The codec's 4:2:2 colour sampling provides ultra-fine transitions in tone and colour for maintaining the highest image quality needed for advanced post production processing.

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO3-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 3-section aluminium tripod with a 90° centre column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 pl plate.

The processor also provides notable speed throughout the camera system, including the ability to record up to 7 fps in full-resolution, quickened AF speeds, and full HD 1080p video recording. The 3.0-inch Clear View II touchscreen LCD monitor profits greatly from the advent Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and its ability to utilize Touch AF focusing for finely controlled selection of the point of focus.

Work faster, with greater confidence thanks to even more refined ergonomics. And change your point of view with Sony’s highly capable 18-110mm servo zoom. Welcome to the next level in handheld shooting.
Electronic Variable ND
Here’s a fresh way to control exposure. Aperture adjustments affect your depth of field. Shutter speed adjustments affect the presentation of motion. But Sony’s Electronic Variable ND maintains optimum exposure without sacrificing any other parameters. Auto ND mode achieves auto exposure with cine lenses, rangefinder glass and third-party SLR lenses. And Auto ND empowers you to park your iris at the lens “sweet spot,” where distortions are lowest and resolution is highest.
Lever Lock type E-Mount
A robust E-Mount with a locking collar makes for more confident lens changes. To mount, simply hold the lens steady and turn the collar instead. When the collar clicks, your lens is securely locked into place. This minimizes image shifting as you work. The Lever Lock type E-Mount also supports heavier cine and ENG lenses without additional rigging. As before, the camera accepts Sony’s E-Mount lenses, along with simple third-party adaptors for PL mount cinema lenses, SLR and DSLR glass, and even classic rangefinder lenses.
Ergonomics to work faster, with more confidence
The ergonomics set the FS7 apart. Now they’re even better. Put the viewfinder exactly where you want it with the robust multi-adjustable arm. Extend Sony’s telescoping Smart Grip arm entirely without tools. Park the arm alongside the body for waist-level shooting. Then experience the Smart Grip, body shape and balance that so many cinematographers have praised.
And more
To the 4K Super35 performance of the original PXW-FS7, the FS7 II also adds the following refinements.

ITU-R BT.2020 recording is directly compatible with BT.2020 distribution
Pop-up LCD monitor hood in addition to the detachable eyepiece
Improved eyepiece hook for more secure attachment

For brilliant image quality it has one high-precision aspheric lens to reduce chromatic aberration throughout the zoom range. It features optimized lens coatings to ensure exceptional color balance while minimizing ghosting and flare and a 7-blade circular aperture to ensure beautiful, soft backgrounds. For outstanding performance, the EF-S 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens perfectly complements the movie servo AF feature found on select EOS cameras with a compact six-group zoom system and a stepping motor and focus mechanism to deliver smooth and quiet continuous AF during movie shooting. Still photography benefits from a high-speed CPU and an optimized AF algorithm. Full-time manual focus is available in AF mode and the front element does not rotate during focus, perfect for use with polarizing filters. Handheld photography is enhanced by the lens' optical image stabilizer system, offering the equivalent of four stops of compensation.

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

Starting with a full-frame 12.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor, the a7S II is capable of internal UHD 4K recording at 30 fps with full pixel readout as well as 1080p recording at up to 120 fps, all in the XAVC S format. For both stills and video recording, the BIONZ X image processor also pairs with the sensor to enable expanded sensitivity to ISO 409600, continuous shooting to 5 fps, and fast intelligent autofocus with low-light sensitivity to -4 EV. Further enabling working in difficult lighting conditions, 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization compensates for vertical, horizontal, pitch, yaw, and roll camera movements for sharper, smoother handheld recording.


A7SII Features:
12MP Exmor CMOS sensor
RAW output 14 bit
Internal 4K recording with higher dynamic range
5 axis stabilization
Much improved AF in low light conditions (169 AF points)

With sensitivity settings that can extend up to ISO 409600 (Standard ISO range: 100-102400 for stills and movies. Expandable ISO range: 50-409600 for stills, 100-409600 for movies) plus extra-wide dynamic range, the Î±7S II can record images in spectacular and subtle detail, from shadows to highlights, under virtually any lighting conditions. The remarkable clarity and lack of noise in stills and movies that you shoot help provide the results that you've been aiming for.

Exmorâ¢ CMOS for extra sensor perception: Capture stills and movies of richer, more natural gradation. The 35mm full-frame 12.2-megapixel image sensor achieves wide dynamic range with very low noise throughout a vast ISO 50-409600 sensitivity span. Large pixels, gapless on-chip lens structure, and other light capture advances allow use of extra-high shutter speeds for low-light shooting.

The newly refined image processing algorithm of the BIONZ X optimizes image sensor performance for superior depiction of details in stills and movies throughout all sensitivity ranges. This image processing engine achieves image quality of such fine nuance and minimal noise, particularly at the mid- to high-sensitivity setting.

The 2-1/2 grip head consists of a pair of rotating aluminum discs attached to a 5/8 (16 mm) receiver. The discs have four different sized V shaped jaws to accept any accessory with a 5/8, 1/2, 3/8 or 1/4 mounting stud or tubing. The V shaped jaws have teeth that grab whatever is mounted between the plates securely. The 2-1/2 grip head features an oversized ergonomic T handle and dedicated roller bearings designed for maximum torque. The grip head uses a non-slip aluminum friction disc that will maintain its durability over time that offers the user positive locking strength and precise control, and is constructed around a solid steel central bolt with a fixed solid pin to secure it to the aluminum casting for increased strength and durability. The 40 grip arm is almost always used in conjunction with a 2 1/2 grip head, giving you complete flexibility to position a gobo go between the light and a subject such as flags, scrims and silks as well as other accessories virtually anywhere.

                        The 35mm f/1.8 OSS Alpha E-mount Prime Lens from Sony is a sharp, prime lens for Sony E-mount cameras, including the Alpha NEX-5R, Alpha NEX-6 and the NEX Handycam camcorders. It is a compact, fixed focal length lens which is equivalent to 52.5mm in 35mm equivalency. A fast maximum aperture of f/1.8 means the lens is ideal for blur-free capture of fast moving subjects and for retaining crisp imaging in low light.
A quiet linear motor controls focus while an in-lens stepping motor controls aperture, together they offer smooth and virtually silent lens action, which is ideal for shooting video. Direct Manual Focus is also featured which allows for fine manual focus control and is operable even in autofocus mode. Sony's built-in Optical Image Stabilization system provides approximately 4-stops worth of shake control, making the lens even more functional in low light conditions and great when tracking moving subjects in video.

It is designed with Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology and is compact and light. This high zoom ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). The image stabilizer effect is equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon's 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. It also uses a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration for excellent image quality throughout the zoom range. Filter Size - 58mm Max.

                        Canon TC-80N3 Camera Remote Control /Timer
    
        The Canon TC-80N3 remote lets you control the shutter of your Canon EOS, from a maximum distance of 0.8 meters. Besides ease of use the cable remote also prevents camera shake because you do not have to touch the camera when taking a picture. This is especially important when using slow shutter speeds so you can help to avoid blurry images.
The TC-80N3 can be used to time accurately exposures from 1 second to 99 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds.
